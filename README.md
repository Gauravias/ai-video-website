# ai-video-website
I build an AI designed website using Midjourney with video components created using RunwayML Gen2 Image to Video feature. I use Photoshop to isolate and clean up all the images and then use Topaz AI's Gigapixel app to upscale the images.  Then I bring them into RunwayML to use its Image to Video feature called Gen2.
